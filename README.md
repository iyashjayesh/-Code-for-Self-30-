## Hey techies, I hope you all are doing good. I'm excited to start a series of Competitive Programming for 30 days. Where I will be sharing the coding question from different categories of Competitive Programming.not only the Questions, I will also upload the solution and the detailed explanation of each &amp; every single line. #codeforself30 #codeforself Competitive programming is a sport, just like any other sport. You walk in to play and try to score, you may fail or you may succeed. Try scoring a few more times and you can eventually hit a home run!!. In Competitive Programming, we design the algorithm (a fancy word for the solution of a problem) and code that solution in our favourite programming language and submit it. If our solution passes all the test cases, we score otherwise we analyze our solution, re-design, and re-submit. 

You donâ€™t need to know any advanced level algorithm or data-structure to get started. You can always start with the basic level contests where you are only required to translate English to any programming language and with the time you can start solving harder problems on your own. It Enhances our Problem Solving Skills.
